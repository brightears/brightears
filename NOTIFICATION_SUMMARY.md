## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Customer submits inquiry** → Quick inquiry form on artist profile
2. **API creates booking** → Status: INQUIRY
3. **Notification triggered** → Async, non-blocking
4. **Email sent** → Professional HTML email via Resend
5. **SMS sent** → Short alert via Twilio
6. **In-app notification created** → Dashboard notification badge
7. **Artist notified** → Multiple channels ensure visibility
8. **Artist responds** → Fast response increases booking rate

### Technical Flow

```
Quick Inquiry API
    ↓
Create Booking (status: INQUIRY)
    ↓
notifyArtistOfInquiry() [async]
    ├── Check artist preferences
    ├── Get user locale (EN/TH)
    ├── Send email notification
    │   ├── Render template
    │   ├── Send via Resend
    │   └── Log to database
    ├── Send SMS notification
    │   ├── Format phone number
    │   ├── Generate message
    │   ├── Send via Twilio
    │   └── Log to console
    └── Create in-app notification
        └── Insert to Notification table
```

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Inquiry always created successfully
- Notifications don't block API response
- Failed notifications logged but don't error
- At least one method must succeed
- Detailed error tracking

**Retry Logic:**
- Email: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- SMS: 2 attempts with 2-second delays
- Automatic retry on transient failures

SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'SENT') as sent,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'FAILED') as failed,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'SENT')::numeric /
    COUNT(*)::numeric * 100,
    2
  ) as success_rate
FROM "EmailLog"
