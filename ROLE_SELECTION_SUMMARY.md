Option 3: Ticket/Event SVG (clear action metaphor)
```

**Artist Path - Current**: Musical Note
**Artist Path - Recommended**:
```typescript
Option 1: Microphone SVG (stronger performer association)
Option 2: Stage/Spotlight SVG (aspirational)
Option 3: Guitar/Instrument üé∏ (emoji - clear & versatile)
```

### Quick Icon Swap (If Desired)
Simply update the icon JSX in RoleSelectionModal.tsx lines 115 and 175.

---

## Copy Recommendations

### English (Current - Good)
**Title**: "How can we help you today?"
**Customer**: "I'm Looking to Book Entertainment"
**Artist**: "I'm an Entertainer"

### Alternative Headlines (A/B Test Options)
**Title Variants**:
- "Welcome to Bright Ears! Let's get started"
- "What brings you here today?"
- "Choose your journey"

**Customer Variants**:
- "Find Perfect Entertainment"
- "Book an Artist for My Event"
- "I Need Entertainment"

**Artist Variants**:

### Thai Translations (Professional)
Already implemented with culturally appropriate phrasing. Current copy is conversion-optimized.

---

## Integration Guide

### Already Integrated
The modal is already integrated into the Hero component and will work immediately upon deployment.

### Alternative Integration Points (Optional)

**1. Global Header CTA**:
```typescript
// In Header.tsx
<button onClick={() => setShowRoleModal(true)}>
  Get Started
</button>
```

**2. Dedicated Landing Page**:
```typescript
// Create /welcome route
<RoleSelectionModal isOpen={true} onClose={() => router.push('/')} />
```

**3. Exit Intent (Advanced)**:
```typescript
// Trigger on mouse leaving viewport
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseLeave = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    if (e.clientY <= 0 && !hasSeenModal) setShowModal(true)
  }
  document.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave)
}, [])
```
