### 🔑 Environment Variables Needed

### 💡 Key Decisions Made
1. Start with music categories (DJ, Band, Singer), expand later
2. Use Render PostgreSQL instead of Supabase
3. English-first interface (corporate clients)
4. Progressive verification (no payment required)
5. Focus on Bangkok first, then expand
