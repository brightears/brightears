# Bright Ears Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a commission-free entertainment booking platform for Thailand, starting with DJs/musicians and expanding to all entertainment categories.

**CORE FOCUS**: Simple, spam-protected bookings with Thailand-specific features (LINE, PromptPay, Buddhist calendar)

## Current Status (August 12, 2024)

### ✅ Completed
1. **Project Setup**
   - Next.js 14 with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Bilingual support (EN/TH) with next-intl
   - SEO optimization from day one

2. **Deployment**
   - GitHub repository: https://github.com/brightears/brightears
   - Deployed on Render (not Vercel)
   - Live at: brightears-xxx.onrender.com
   - Custom domain ready: brightears.io

3. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL on Render (Singapore region)
   - Prisma ORM configured
   - Database URL: postgresql://brightears_db_user:5suMKqzZIpREdOYOWGgkrCC9jHBdNP7m@dpg-d2cc14h5pdvs73dh7dvg-a.singapore-postgres.render.com/brightears_db
   - All tables created and ready

4. **Database Schema**
   - User system with roles (Artist, Customer, Corporate, Admin)
   - Artist profiles with verification levels
   - Booking system with status tracking
   - Review and rating system
   - Messaging system
   - Notifications
   - Availability management
   - Support for multiple categories (DJ, Band, Singer, etc.)

5. **Artist Features** (NEW)
   - Artist registration API with validation
   - Artist listing page with pagination
   - Category and location filtering
   - Search functionality
   - Individual artist profile pages
   - Rating and review display system

### 🚀 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Week 1)
1. **Simplify Homepage**
   - Clean search: Location + Date + Category
   - Show "From ฿XXX" pricing
   - Professional artist cards
   - "Browse without login" working properly

2. **Fix Contact Protection**
   - Browse freely → Login to contact → Message in-platform
   - Only reveal LINE/phone after booking confirmed
   - Prevent spam while keeping it simple

3. **Make OAuth Work**
   - Google OAuth for international/corporate
   - LINE Login for Thai customers (priority!)
   - Simple email/password as backup

### 📅 NEXT PHASE (Week 2-4)
1. **Thailand-Specific Features**
   - LINE Bot for notifications (not direct contact)
   - PromptPay QR codes for payments
   - Buddhist holiday calendar
   - Thai language throughout (not just translations)

2. **Revenue Model**
   - FREE: Basic artist profiles
   - PREMIUM (฿499/mo): Unlimited photos, top placement, analytics
   - NO COMMISSION on bookings (our key differentiator!)

### 📝 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES
- **SIMPLICITY FIRST** - If it takes more than 3 clicks, it's too complex
- **NO COMMISSION** - Loud and clear on every page
- **SPAM PROTECTION** - Never expose artist contacts without verified booking
- **THAILAND-NATIVE** - LINE > Email, PromptPay > Credit Cards, Thai > English
- **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE** - Browse free → Login to contact → Pay to confirm
- **MOBILE FIRST** - 91% of Thai users are on mobile

### 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS
- Can a user find and contact an artist in under 60 seconds?
- Do artists feel protected from spam?
- Is the 0% commission clear?
- Does it feel "Thai" not "Western"?

### 🎨 CRITICAL DESIGN STANDARDS (Apply to ALL new pages/components)
**COLORS - 4 Brand Colors + White:**
- `brand-cyan` (#00bbe4) - Primary CTAs, links, active states
- `deep-teal` (#2f6364) - Dark backgrounds, headers, footers
- `earthy-brown` (#a47764) - Secondary buttons, warm accents
- `soft-lavender` (#d59ec9) - Badges, special highlights (sparingly)
- `pure-white` (#ffffff) - Cards, text on dark backgrounds

**Supporting neutrals (backgrounds/text only):**
- `off-white` (#f7f7f7) - Main page backgrounds
- `dark-gray` (#333333) - All body text

**TYPOGRAPHY - Apply consistently:**
- ALL H1-H3 headlines: `font-playfair` (serif font)
- ALL body text, buttons, UI: `font-inter` (sans-serif)
- Thai content: `font-noto-thai`
- Never use default system fonts
- Maintain this hierarchy on every new component

### 🔧 Technical Details
- **Root Directory**: Repository has all files at root (not in subdirectory)
- **Build Command**: `prisma generate && next build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Node Version**: 22.16.0
- **Region**: Singapore (for Thailand proximity)
