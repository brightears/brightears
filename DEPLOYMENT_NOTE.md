# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT NOTE ðŸš¨

## **THIS PROJECT RUNS ON RENDER, NOT LOCALHOST!**

### Production URL: https://brightears.onrender.com

### Deployment Process:
1. **All changes are automatically deployed** when pushed to GitHub
2. **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/brightears/brightears
3. **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/

### When we make changes:
1. We push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Render automatically detects the push
3. Render builds and deploys (takes ~3-5 minutes)
4. Changes are LIVE at https://brightears.onrender.com

### DO NOT focus on localhost:
- localhost:3000 or localhost:3001 is ONLY for quick testing
- The REAL app that users access is on RENDER
- Always think "How will this work on Render?" not "How will this work on localhost?"

### Current Status (August 26, 2024):
âœ… Site is STABLE and WORKING after Clerk integration
âœ… All Convex code removed (was causing production crashes)
âœ… Authentication fully functional with Google OAuth
âœ… Build succeeding without TypeScript errors
âœ… Deployment pipeline working smoothly

### Recovery Checkpoint:
If the site breaks in future development, we have a stable checkpoint:
```bash
git checkout stable-clerk-auth-v1
```

### To check deployment status:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on "brightears" web service
3. Check the "Events" tab for deployment progress

**REMEMBER: We develop for RENDER (production), not localhost!**
