## Booking Flow Architecture

### Customer Journey
1. Search/Browse → 
2. View Profile → 
3. Check Availability → 
4. Request Quote → 
5. Chat (Line) → 
6. Confirm Booking → 
7. Contract Sign → 
8. Payment → 
9. Event → 
10. Review

### Key Conversion Points
- Profile → Inquiry: 25% target
- Inquiry → Booking: 40% target  
- Booking → Review: 80% target

## Availability Management

### Calendar System
```javascript
const availabilitySchema = {
  artistId: UUID,
  availableSlots: [
    {
      date: Date,
      timeSlots: ['morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'night'],
      status: 'available' | 'booked' | 'hold' | 'blackout'
    }
  ],
  advanceNotice: 7, // days required
  minimumHours: 3,
  bufferTime: 60, // minutes between gigs
  timezone: 'Asia/Bangkok'
};
```

### Conflict Prevention
- Real-time availability checking
- 24-hour hold system
- Travel time calculation
- Double-booking prevention
- Timezone handling

## Quote System

### Smart Pricing
```javascript
const calculateQuote = (request) => {
  let basePrice = artist.hourlyRate * request.hours;
  
  // Adjustments
  if (request.dayOfWeek === 'Saturday') basePrice *= 1.2;
  if (request.isHoliday) basePrice *= 1.5;
  if (request.distance > 50) basePrice += transportCost;
  if (request.lastMinute) basePrice *= 1.3;
  
  return {
    base: basePrice,
    adjustments: [...],
    total: finalPrice,
    validUntil: Date.now() + 48*60*60*1000
  };
};
```

### Quote Templates
- Standard event quote

## Line Integration for Booking

  await trackEvent('line_chat_initiated', {
    customerId,
    artistId,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    bookingStage: 'inquiry'
  });
  
  // Generate tracked Line link
  const lineLink = `https://line.me/R/ti/p/@${artist.lineId}?bookingId=${bookingId}`;
  
  // Send notification to artist
  await sendLineNotification(artist.lineId, 'New inquiry from Bright Ears');
  
  return lineLink;
