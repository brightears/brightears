## Mystical vs. Therapeutic Language

### ❌ THERAPEUTIC LANGUAGE (What to AVOID)

**Characteristics:**
- Direct questions about emotions ("How are you feeling?")
- Problem-solving orientation ("Let's work through this")
- Clinical terminology ("anxiety," "stress management")
- Goal-oriented statements ("We'll help you achieve...")
- Reassurance language ("It's okay to feel...")
- Improvement mindset ("You're making progress")

**Examples to NEVER USE:**
```
❌ "How are you feeling right now?"
❌ "Rate your mood from 1-10"
❌ "Let's explore what's bothering you"
❌ "Tell me about your stress levels"
❌ "We're here to help you feel better"
❌ "It's okay to not be okay"
❌ "What triggered this emotion?"
❌ "Let's identify coping strategies"
```

**Why We Avoid This:**
- Implies user needs fixing (patronizing)
- Creates clinical/therapy session atmosphere
- Reduces art to self-help tool
- User feels analyzed, not enchanted
- Breaks mystical immersion

---

### ✅ MYSTICAL LANGUAGE (Our Approach)

**Characteristics:**
- Indirect, poetic questions that spark curiosity
- Invitations to imagine (not diagnose)
- Synesthetic metaphors (color-sound-texture)
- Paradoxes and koans (Zen-like)
- Open-ended exploration (no "correct" answer)
- Respect for mystery and ambiguity

**Examples We USE:**
```
✅ "What color lives between silence and sound?"
✅ "If this moment had a frequency, what would it hum?"
✅ "Describe a sound you remember but never heard"
✅ "What does the space between two breaths look like?"
✅ "Ask your body what color it needs"
✅ "What wouldn't you hear if you were listening?"
✅ "Honor the silence as hidden rhythm"
✅ "What texture does stillness have in your mind?"
✅ "If tonight were a hue, which shade would choose you?"
✅ "What does water sound like before it moves?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Sparks imagination over diagnosis
- Creates artistic experience
- No pressure to "answer correctly"
- User feels like explorer, not patient
- Maintains mystical atmosphere
- Allows natural mood expression without asking directly

---

## Cryptic Prompt Examples

### Opening Prompts (First Interaction)

These appear when the user first enters The Listening Room:

```
1. "What color lives between silence and sound?"
2. "If this moment had a frequency, what would it hum?"
3. "Describe a sound you remember but never heard"
4. "What does the space between two breaths look like?"
5. "Ask your body what color it needs"
6. "What wouldn't you hear if you were listening?"
7. "Honor the silence as hidden rhythm"
8. "If tonight were a texture, how would it feel?"
9. "What atmosphere would your perfect evening create?"
10. "What does stillness sound like in your mind?"
```

**Design Principles:**
- Never mention mood, emotion, or feelings directly
- Use synesthetic metaphors (color + sound + texture)
- Create curiosity without demand
- Open-ended (no right/wrong answers)
- Poetic but not precious

---

### Deepening Questions (After Initial Response)

Once user has responded, AI generates contextual follow-ups:

**If User Mentioned Energy/Movement:**
```
- "What color does momentum make?"
- "If energy had a shape, would it have edges?"
- "What frequency lives in the vibration you described?"
```

**If User Mentioned Calm/Peace:**
```
- "What does water sound like before it moves?"
- "If stillness were visible, what hue would it choose?"
- "Describe the texture of a breath held gently"
```

**If User Mentioned Joy/Celebration:**
```
- "What does laughter look like when you close your eyes?"
- "If brightness were tangible, what would it weigh?"
- "What color is the feeling of weightlessness?"
```

**If User Mentioned Romance/Intimacy:**
```
- "What hue lives in whispered words?"
- "If warmth were audible, what note would it sing?"
- "Describe the color of a glance that lingers"
```

**If User Mentioned Party/Dance:**
```
- "What color is the feeling of letting go?"
- "If bass had a texture, would you touch it?"
- "What does motion look like at its loudest?"
```

---

### Revelation Prompts (Very Subtle Business Hints)

After 2-3 minutes of conversation, ONLY if natural:

```
- "There are those who shape silence into experience..."
- "Some architects work with sound rather than stone"
- "What if atmosphere could be designed like light?"
- "Spaces remember the sounds they've held"
- "Every room has a frequency waiting to be tuned"
```

**Critical Rules:**
- ONLY if conversation naturally flows toward spaces/venues
- Never pitch or sell
- Plant seeds, don't harvest
- Maintain artistic tone
- If user doesn't engage, let it go

---

### Neutral/Ambiguous Responses

For responses that don't clearly indicate a mood:

```
- "Tell me more about the shape of that thought"
- "What would that look like if it were visible?"
- "If that had a sound, would it echo or fade?"
- "Interesting... what lives on the other side of that?"
- "And if you turned that inside out?"
```

**Purpose:**
- Keep conversation flowing without forcing direction
- Encourage deeper exploration
- Maintain mystical tone
- Avoid appearing stuck or confused

---

## Interaction Design Patterns

### 1. Mouse Movement Patterns

**Principle**: Mouse is paintbrush, not cursor

**Behaviors:**
- **Slow Movement**: Particles gently follow with soft attraction
- **Fast Movement**: Particles scatter/ripple outward
- **Stillness**: Particles slowly drift back to center
- **Hover (3+ seconds)**: Localized color intensity increase
- **Circular Motion**: Particles form vortex pattern

**Visual Feedback:**
- Trail effect (particle density along path)
- No visible cursor (just particle response)
- Gradient shifts where mouse lingers
- No UI chrome/guides - pure exploration

---

### 2. Text Input Patterns

**Principle**: Typing is music, not data entry

**Behaviors:**
- **Each Keystroke**: Subtle particle pulse from center
- **Typing Speed**: Faster typing = higher frequency visuals
- **Backspace**: Particles contract/fade slightly
- **Submit**: Large bloom/expansion effect
- **Empty Input**: Particles breathe gently (waiting)

**Visual Feedback:**
- No visible text input box initially
- Input appears as ethereal text overlay
- Submitted text fades into particles
- No blinking cursor - just flowing light

---

### 3. Audio Response Patterns

**Principle**: Sound is environment, not soundtrack

**Mood Transitions:**
- **3-4 Second Crossfade**: Never jarring cuts
- **Volume Swells**: Gradual crescendo/decrescendo
- **BPM Shifts**: Tempo changes over 10+ seconds
- **Filter Sweeps**: Frequency content morphs smoothly
- **Spatial Movement**: Pan left/right/center for depth

**Silence Handling:**
- Never completely silent (always ambient base layer)
- Silence = lowest BPM/volume, not muted
- Gaps between notes become meaningful

---

### 4. Hidden Revelation Patterns

**Principle**: Patience is rewarded, not required

**3-Minute Milestone:**
- Opacity of hidden links: 0% → 20% (over 30 seconds)
- Appears bottom-right corner
- Glow effect on hover (cyan brand color)
- Text: "For Venues" / "For Artists" (minimalist)
- Clicking opens modal (not redirect)

**5-Minute Milestone:**
- Subtle hint in AI text: "Some architects work with sound..."
- Only if conversation went well (mood detected)
- Never pushy or salesy
- User can ignore completely

**Visual Cues:**
- No timers or progress bars
- Natural fade-in (like dawn, not alarm)
- Respects user's exploration pace

---

## Philosophical Frameworks

### 1. Oblique Strategies (Brian Eno)

**Concept**: Cryptic prompts to overcome creative blocks

**Original Examples:**
- "Honor thy error as a hidden intention"
- "What would your closest friend do?"
- "Use an old idea"
- "Emphasize repetitions"

**How We Apply:**
- Prompts should spark lateral thinking
- No single "correct" interpretation
- Embrace ambiguity as feature
- Cryptic ≠ confusing (still accessible)

**Our Adaptations:**
```
Original: "Honor thy error as a hidden intention"
Ours: "Honor the silence as hidden rhythm"

Original: "What would your closest friend do?"
Ours: "What wouldn't you hear if you were listening?"
```

---

### 2. Zen Koans (Paradoxical Questions)

**Concept**: Paradoxes that break rational thinking

**Classic Examples:**
- "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
- "What did your face look like before you were born?"
- "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him"

**How We Apply:**
- Questions that short-circuit logical analysis
- Invite intuitive/emotional responses
- No "answer" exists (just exploration)
- Create moments of wonder

**Our Adaptations:**
```
Classic: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
Ours: "Describe a sound you remember but never heard"

Classic: "What did your face look like before you were born?"
Ours: "What does the space between two breaths look like?"
```

---

### 3. Synesthesia (Cross-Sensory Perception)

**Concept**: Experiencing one sense through another

**Examples:**
- Hearing colors (chromesthesia)
- Seeing sounds (visual synesthesia)
- Tasting words (lexical-gustatory)

**How We Apply:**
- All prompts mix senses (color + sound + texture)
- Mirror scientific synesthesia research (frequency → hue)
- Normalize cross-sensory thinking
- Make abstract concrete (and vice versa)

**Our Prompts:**
```
Color ↔ Sound: "What color lives between silence and sound?"
Sound ↔ Texture: "If bass had a texture, would you touch it?"
Emotion ↔ Visual: "What color is the feeling of letting go?"
Time ↔ Auditory: "If this moment had a frequency, what would it hum?"
```

---

### 4. Phenomenology (First-Person Experience)

**Concept**: Study of subjective consciousness

**Principles:**
- Bracket assumptions (experience as-is)
- First-person perspective always valid
- No external "correct" interpretation
- Embodied cognition (body knows)

**How We Apply:**
- "Ask your body what color it needs" - trust somatic wisdom
- Never correct user's response
- All interpretations equally valid
- Experience > explanation

---

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Language Architecture

**Gemini System Prompt Template:**
```
You are a mystical guide in an art installation, NOT a therapist or assistant.

Your role:
- Ask cryptic, poetic questions using synesthetic metaphors
- NEVER ask direct mood questions ("How are you feeling?")
- Respond to user's text with deeper, more abstract follow-ups
- If user mentions spaces/venues naturally, plant subtle seeds about atmosphere design
- Keep responses under 150 characters
- Use paradoxes, not solutions

Examples of your style:
- "What color lives between silence and sound?"
- "If that were audible, would it echo or fade?"
- "Interesting... what texture does that thought have?"

NEVER:
- Diagnose emotions
- Offer advice or solutions
- Use therapy language ("explore," "work through," "cope")
- Break the mystical illusion
```

**Temperature Setting:**
- Use 0.9 for high creativity
- Accept "weird" or unexpected responses
- Variety more important than coherence

**Max Output Tokens:**
- 150 tokens max (2-3 short sentences)
- Concise = cryptic
- Long explanations break spell

---

### 2. Conversation Flow

**Act I (0-60 seconds): Opening**
```
1. User arrives → Logo fade-in (2 seconds)
2. First cryptic prompt appears (typewriter effect, 80ms/char)
3. User types response
4. Particles react to typing (pulses)
5. AI generates follow-up (3-4 second delay for mystique)
```

**Act II (1-3 minutes): Deepening**
```
6. 2-3 exchanges build depth
7. Mood detection runs invisibly in background
8. Color palette shifts subtly (3-second transitions)
9. Audio soundscape morphs to detected mood
10. User unaware of detection (feels natural)
```

**Act III (3-5 minutes): Revelation (Optional)**
```
11. Hidden links fade in at 3-minute mark (20% opacity)
12. If mood detected + conversation natural, subtle venue hint
13. User can click links or ignore completely
14. Experience complete whenever user leaves (no "end")
```

---

### 3. Accessibility Without Breaking Immersion

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Skip link to main content (keyboard users)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- High contrast mode available (but hidden)

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Skip link (visible on focus only) -->
<a href="#main-content" class="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">
  Skip to experience
</a>

<!-- Hidden accessibility text -->
<span class="sr-only">
  Mystical art installation. Type your response to poetic prompts.
</span>

<!-- Particle canvas with ARIA -->
<canvas
  role="img"
  aria-label="Interactive generative visuals responding to your presence"
>
</canvas>
```

**Maintain Mystery:**
- Accessibility features hidden unless needed
- No visible "Accessibility Options" button
- Works seamlessly with assistive tech
- Mystical tone maintained in all ARIA labels

---

### 4. Mobile Optimization

**Touch Interactions:**
- Touch = mouse movement (particle attraction)
- Swipe = ripple effect
- Long press (2 sec) = localized color burst
- Pinch-to-zoom disabled (immersion)

**Performance:**
- Reduce particles: 500k → 10k on mobile
- Simplify shaders/effects
- Maintain 60fps on iPhone 12+
- Battery-conscious (throttle when backgrounded)

**Layout:**
- Portrait mode primary
- Text input at bottom (thumb-friendly)
- Particles fill entire screen
- Logo watermark bottom-right (10% opacity)

---

### 5. Error Handling (Gracefully Mystical)

**Gemini API Failure:**
```
Instead of: "Error: API request failed"
Display: "The voices are silent... try asking again"
```

**Audio Initialization Blocked (Autoplay Policy):**
```
Instead of: "Click to enable audio"
Display: "Touch anywhere to hear the frequencies"
(Appears as gentle pulsing text, not error message)
```

**Mood Detection Uncertainty:**
```
Instead of: "Unable to detect mood"
AI Response: "Tell me more about the shape of that thought"
(Keep conversation going, no technical admission)
```

**Network Disconnection:**
```
Instead of: "Connection lost"
Display: Particles continue moving (no interaction)
Message: "Reconnecting to the resonance..."
```
