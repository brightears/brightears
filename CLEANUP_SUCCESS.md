# The Listening Room - Cleanup Success Summary

**Date:** December 24, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE - Build Successful
**Backup Tag:** backup-before-cleanup

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

**NEVER use localhost for testing. ALWAYS deploy to Render.**

### Standard Workflow:
1. **Write Code** → Make changes in local editor
2. **Commit to GitHub** → `git add .` && `git commit -m "message"`
3. **Push to GitHub** → `git push origin main`
4. **Render Auto-Deploys** → Automatic deployment triggered
5. **Test Live** → Test at https://brightears.onrender.com/listening-room

**Remember:** Code → GitHub → Render → Test Live (NEVER localhost)

---

## CLEANUP COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

All booking platform code has been removed and The Listening Room project now builds successfully with zero errors.
