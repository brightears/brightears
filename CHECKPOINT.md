## Recent Fixes (What This Checkpoint Includes)

### Deployment Recovery (Oct 9, 2025)
**Problem:** 5 consecutive failed deployments from commit `bcfcc27`

**Root Causes:**
1. Zod enum syntax error using deprecated `errorMap` parameter
2. Missing Suspense boundaries for client components using `useSearchParams()`

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **lib/validation/schemas.ts**
   - Fixed `errorMap` ‚Üí `message` in z.enum()
   - Fixed TypeScript assertion in `conditionalRequired` helper

2. **app/[locale]/register/layout.tsx** (created)
   - Added Suspense boundary for register page
   - Handles `?type=customer/corporate` query params

3. **app/[locale]/onboarding/layout.tsx** (created)
   - Added Suspense boundary for onboarding page
   - Handles Clerk useUser() hook

**Result:** Build successful, all 5 prerender errors resolved ‚úÖ
