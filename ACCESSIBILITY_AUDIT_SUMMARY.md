# Accessibility Audit Summary
## Bright Ears Entertainment Booking Platform

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Live Site:** https://brightears.onrender.com
**Checkpoint:** `checkpoint-registration-complete`

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Score: 7.2/10 ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE

The Bright Ears platform has **strong foundations** in form accessibility but suffers from **critical barriers** in interactive elements, color contrast, and screen reader support that will prevent users with disabilities from completing core tasks like artist registration and onboarding.

### Key Findings
- **38 accessibility issues** identified across 168 React components
- **8 critical issues** blocking core functionality for disabled users
- **12 high-priority** barriers significantly impacting usability
- **18 medium-priority** improvements for better user experience

### Impact Assessment
- **~5-10% of users** (keyboard-only, screen reader, low vision) will face barriers
- **Artist registration/onboarding** currently inaccessible to blind users
- **Payment flow** lacks timing controls required by WCAG
- **Navigation** missing skip links (critical for efficiency)
